# BCS Hackathon 2023 - Workflow Whiz

As students, we have very busy schedules. Some currently available task managers have many features and functionalities, which can be a bit overwhelming. Creating a schedule or to do list should be quick and easy - it shouldn't be as difficult as studying for our exam next week!

The Workflow Whiz aims to tackle that problem. We, the Workflow Wizards, wanted to create a task manager that is simple and visually appealing. 

## Peg Board

The site's main page is the Peg Board - a place to add quick notes or reminders in a way that is less organized. It's more representative of the chaos that goes on in our heads when planning our schedules. 

## Calendar

From the main page, you can also navigate to the calendar. This page shows a more structured schedule. Here, you can add an event, and on the calendar, you can select a day to show which events are scheduled on that day.

## Alerts

## Implementation

This web app was developed in HTML and JavaScript - all completely new to us Wizards! 

## Beyond This Weekend

For future implementation, we would like to complete the calendar section for all months (not just March), and have the user be able to scroll through them using the arrows at the top. 

We would also like to add automations. If, for example, we know we have to do laundry every Friday, we would like to be able to input that somewhere, and have the app automatically add to our To Do list / Events every Friday that we have to do laundry.
